# Stock Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning Techniques

Welcome to the Stock Sentiment Analysis project! This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the Finance Club Open Project Summer 2024, titled "Stock Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning Techniques" (#FC24OPS3). The goal of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model to predict stock price movements based on textual data from news articles, social media posts, and other financial news sources.

## Overview

The project aims to harness the power of machine learning to analyze the sentiment expressed in financial texts and uncover insights into investor and market sentiment. These insights can serve as valuable indicators for making informed trading decisions.

## Objectives

1. **Data Collection**: Gather textual data related to stocks from various sources such as news articles, social media posts, earnings reports, and analyst reports.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the textual data by removing noise, tokenizing text, and applying stemming and lemmatization.
3. **Data Labeling**: Label the textual data with corresponding stock price movements to create a supervised learning dataset.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features like word frequencies, sentiment scores, and topic models from the textual data.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, random forests, neural networks) to predict stock price movements based on sentiment.
6. **Model Performance Metrics**: Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve analysis.

## Deliverables

- **Python Notebook**: The main code for sentiment analysis, including functionalities to find buy and sell points based on sentiment, plot them in a chart, and calculate the final portfolio and returns.
- **Report**: Detailed explanation of the code and performance metrics including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdowns, number of trades executed, and win ratio.
